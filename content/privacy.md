When you use this site, as little information as is feasible is collected because the best way to ensure user privacy is to avoid collecting data in the first place.

I collect minimal analytics data, which is collected, stored, and processed in-house. To accomplish this, I use [umami](https://umami.is/), a [humane](https://github.com/humanetech-community/awesome-humane-tech#analytics) option for self-hosted, privacy-preserving web analytics. Analytics data may include any or all of the following: pages viewed, country, referer website, browser, operating system, and generic device type (such as desktop or mobile).

Analytics data is not tracked across other websites or otherwise linked to your browsing or identity, and any data collected is strictly used to ensure that development effort on this project is spent meaningfully.

The end.
