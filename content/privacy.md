## Privacy

When you use this site, as little information as is feasible is collected. I collect analytics data. The analytics data is collected and processed by me, not another service provider like Google. To accomplish this, I use [umami](https://umami.is/), a [humane](https://github.com/humanetech-community/awesome-humane-tech#analytics) option for self-hosted web analytics. Analytics data may include the following: pages viewed, country, referer website, browser, operating system, and generic device type (such as desktop or mobile). This data is not tracked across other websites and is strictly used to ensure that development effort on this project is spent meaningfully.

This website is currently hosted on GitHub Pages using a custom domain name. Your use of this website is subject to [GitHub's privacy practices](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages), which include the collection of logs containing visitors' IP addresses in order to comply with legal requirements as well as maintain the security and integrity of their service.

That's all.
