                        The Howell County Health Department has stopped providing its daily Facebook posts
                        containing data used to produce this dashboard, most notably including case data 
                        by town and test counts. Unless and until that data is made available again, data on 
                        this dashboard will be frozen. The HCHD is now publishing a <a href="https://allthingsmissouri.org/county-covid-19-dashboards/howell-county/">new dashboard</a>
                        in partnership with the University of Missouri Extension.
