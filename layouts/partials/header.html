                        On December 15, the HCHD received a large influx of test results from the state &mdash; adding nearly 800 tests in a single day, which is far above average. Without knowing the dates across which to distribute these tests, this drastic change in the data will impact some quantities shown here, such as the 14-day positivity rate, through the end of the month. <strong>Interpret the data here with caution.</strong>
