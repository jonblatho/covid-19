                        Due to the Presidents&rsquo; Day holiday weekend and inclement weather, the Howell County Health Department has not updated testing data since Thursday, February 11. An update is expected on Monday, February 22. Until then, <strong>interpret testing-related numbers below with caution</strong>.

                        Due to recent inclement weather, testing has fallen sharply, so this dashboard may be unable to fully capture the current state of COVID-19 in the county. While case growth had been on a slowing trend, keep this in mind when interpreting case and testing numbers as things return to normal.
