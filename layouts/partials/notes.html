                    <h3>Methodology</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Most data here comes directly from reports published on most non-holiday 
                            weekdays by the Howell County Health Department (HCHD). To fill in gaps
                            between those reports, when there is a substantial difference through the gap, 
                            I apply a linear equation to estimate the missing data. Where sources are 
                            available, those are linked in the table.
                        <li>
                            Sometimes testing data is missing from a report that is published. When that
                            happens, I take the 7-day average of new tests conducted daily and use that
                            to estimate testing data until reporting resumes. Once it does resume, I 
                            recalculate the estimates using the method mentioned in the above point.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I use HCHD data because, although the Missouri Department of Health and Senior 
                            Services (DHSS) updates its data more often/consistently, DHSS data for Howell 
                            County is lagging woefully behind HCHD&rsquo;s reports for some reason.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            While HCHD reports the total of active cases for the county, data for active
                            cases by town is estimated. This is done by normalizing the 7-day total new 
                            cases for the county and categories (cities and &ldquo;other&rdquo;) and 
                            multiplying the county total active cases by those normalized values. Rounding 
                            may cause the sum of the by-town values not to exactly equal the county total.

                            This page includes both official data and unofficial estimates. For official data,
                            please consult the Howell County Health Department.

                    <h3>Update schedule</h3>
                    <p>
                        Data should be updated by the following times as long as HCHD publishes the requisite
                        data:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Monday&ndash;Thursday data:</strong> Most data by about 1 AM the following day, 
                            testing data by about 11 AM the following day
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Friday&ndash;Sunday data:</strong> Most data by about 1 AM the following day, 
                            testing data by about 11 AM the following Monday
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>DHSS case totals:</strong> Updated every 1&ndash;2 days.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Missing data</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            HCHD did not begin providing an active case count until April 23, 2020.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Testing data isn&rsquo;t available prior to August 19, 2020. That&rsquo;s when
                            HCHD began consistently publishing the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests conducted, 
                            rather than the number of individuals tested. For consistency, I opted to neither 
                            include nor estimate testing data before that date.
